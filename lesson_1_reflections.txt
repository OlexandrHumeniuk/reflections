Instead of looking through all lines of code
I was able to check only several parts of the file
So it saved lots of time and nerves for me

Instead of rewriting the code in case I've made a
better solution earlier I will be able just to access
the earlier version of my code and use it

Using manual commit can cause trouble if you commit rarely 
but it can be helpful if you make a habit of it and create 
your own logical approach to version control

Programming often includes using several files on one project 
so saving all changes in all files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives a list of commits made to a current repository and comments on them
git diff give a possibility to look through the changes made in two versions of a file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
With version control I will always have my pre-break version saved in case of any problems
and I will be able to compare those versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Front-end coding
