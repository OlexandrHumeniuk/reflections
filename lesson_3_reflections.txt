When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use a remote to score a digital copy of my project to share with other people or general public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because not all changes I've made I wanna see on my computer
