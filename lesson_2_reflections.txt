What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An invisible .git folder is created, where the changes to the files 
will be tracked!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an intermediate plsce to collect files from working
directory before putting it into the repository. It is great to create 
a certain logical steps (changes to the files) before actually committing
something

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The change I have added t staging area should comprise one logical change
before commiting

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful if you want to take several different scenarios in
building you project. It's like taking a different route while being able to go back.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helped to get a feeling about how branching works and how not to loose important commits

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
We are able to intertwin two versions of the project without loosing any commits we've done.
