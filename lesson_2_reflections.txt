What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An invisible .git folder is created, where the changes to the files 
will be tracked!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an intermediate plsce to collect files from working
directory before putting it into the repository. It is great to create 
a certain logical steps (changes to the files) before actually committing
something
